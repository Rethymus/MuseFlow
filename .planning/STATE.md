## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions from v1.4 roadmap:

- **D-17-ROADMAP**: v1.4 phases derived from 18 requirements across 5 categories, 8 phases (standard granularity)
- **D-17-DEPS**: Phases 17 and 18 are independent starting points; Phase 19 depends on both; Phase 21 depends on Phase 20; Phase 23 depends on Phase 17

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Human UAT still needed on physical Windows/Android devices for IME composition, startup/lifecycle behavior
- Anti-AI-scent banned phrase lists should be validated with broader real Chinese prose samples before release sign-off
- Phase 7 bundled template prose needs human literary review before release sign-off

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred from v1.3:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| uat_gap | Phase 00: Windows IME testing | human_needed |
| uat_gap | Phase 14: Chinese IME composition | human_needed |
| tech_debt | Phase 11: 4 non-critical items | deferred |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-12
Stopped at: v1.4 shipped (all 8 phases, 18 requirements validated), ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS synced, 1451 tests passing, Web build verified
Next step: v1.5 改进路线图制定 — 基于前沿研究（35+论文）的深度功能优化
